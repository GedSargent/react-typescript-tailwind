# React Counter README

# What is it?

This is a project for beginners learning React and Tailwind CSS.

Each branch of the project contains a different challenge:

1. Counter
2. Handling form input
3. ToDo app

You can switch between branches easily using the command-line, or an application like (GitHub Desktop)[https://desktop.github.com/].

# Getting Started with Create React App and Tailwind CSS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It also comes with a basic [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) installation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## The challenges

### 1. Counter

Can you update the component code so that clicking the 'Add' button makes the number on screen increment by one every time?

**HINT**: you can use the (useState)[https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useState#reference] hook to solve this. Look at a usage example (here)[https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useState#usage].

If you are REALLY stuck, take a look at a counter example from the React docs page (here)[https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useState#examples-basic].

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
